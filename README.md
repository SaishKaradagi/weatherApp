# Weather App

A simple weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to search for the current weather conditions of a city by entering the city name. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and display it on the web page.

## Project Overview

The Weather App provides real-time weather information, including:
- Current temperature in Celsius
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed in km/h
- Weather icon based on the current conditions

The app allows users to search by city name and view the current weather in that location.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: Enter a city name to get the current weather.
- **Weather Information**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon based on the conditions.
- **Error Handling**: If an invalid city name is entered, an error message is displayed.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the app.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the UI dynamically.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weatherApp.git

2. **Install Dependencies**: Since this project does not have external dependencies, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the app.
   
3. **Search for Weather**: Type a city name in the search bar and hit enter or click the search button to view the weather data for that city.

## API Integration

The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch live weather data. You need to replace the `apiKey` in the `script.js` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key to use this app.

```javascript
const apiKey = "your-api-key";
```
## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weatherApp.git

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the app.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed weather information such as sunrise, sunset, and pressure.
- Include the ability to search weather by coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- Improve the UI/UX design for a more visually appealing experience.
